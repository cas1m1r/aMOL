# a Meaning of Life

                        "Happiness is only real when shared."

## a Problem:
Both the United States, China and seemingly all major systems suffer from the same issues of inequality. It isn't a trend
unique to any particular political system. It's seemingly a product of power being consolidated and withheld. 

In any case, the invention of the internet has brought many great gifts and helped to level this information/power asymmetry.
But it's not very complete as is. Knowledge is dispersed throughout the vastness of the internet, and the **free***ness* 
means anyone and everyone becomes creators. 

In a world  where anyone can write text books and newspapers it is up to the reader to determine if the page they are on is their 
crazy uncle's blog or a respected journalistic institution. 

## a Solution:
'Gamified' Education structured into challenge based modules created by subject experts

This is not a new concept, and other platforms exist. Most are still for profit though and are arguably lacking in quality/depth. 
My goal is to create a place with challenges and content to teach anyone about fundamental and important concepts in a 
range of topics. 

If I can create a way to make this extensible perhaps others who feel so inclined and have some particular subjects/fields
they are passionate about could be enabled to add modules in a way that integrates into a larger "set of courses" or paths. 

## Why?
![truth](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.pinimg.com%2Foriginals%2F38%2Ffa%2F63%2F38fa63d9eefae1bec831f4cc91fdaa93.gif&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=d8a686bb7454a4130d5beccadafa0ea3f1946ad1a1b8c49247c40f1dabee3026&ipo=images)

I just want to see the world get better. We cant end wars, or conflicts. But if we add more and more paths of low resistance
that lead to more positive outcomes for everyone it seems worth trying. And as it stands now, the path of least resistance
for smart young people trying to figure their way out are fraught with fraudsters, tricks and slippery ethical slopes. 

**I know I don't know everything, not even that much really. But I know enough to probably teach someone out there something. 
Don't you think you could too?** 


## How?
- Leverage ChatGPT to create lesson plans; human assisted/curated
- Use existing internet information repositories like Wikipedia to collect knowledge on subject matter
- Build mechanism to reduce information into automatically organized modules
- Have humans review outputs, and curate/add additional resources, challenges, projects associated with the topic. 
- Implement a system to rank quality of information sources and let people rank how helpful modules are for a given topic
- Continue to consider ways this could be improved



### DISCLAIMER
*I respect, appreciate and admire the many platforms that have "gamified" education. This is not meant to threaten them in 
any way. The subjects I intend to explore are ones I don't see covered in this places, and furthermore I have no intention
or plans to monetize this is anyway, nor use the semblance/language/or ideas directly attributed to any existing entity.*
